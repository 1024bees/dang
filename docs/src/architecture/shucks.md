# Shucks Module

The Shucks module implements the GDB Remote Serial Protocol (RSP) that enables debugger clients to communicate with DANG.

## Overview

Shucks handles all aspects of the GDB protocol:
- Packet parsing and validation
- Command interpretation and routing
- Response formatting and transmission
- Protocol state management

## Key Components

### Client Connection (`client.rs`)

Manages GDB client connections and protocol state.

### Packet Handling (`packet.rs`)

Parses and serializes GDB protocol packets.

### Command Processing (`commands.rs`)

Interprets GDB commands and routes them to appropriate handlers.

### Response Generation (`response.rs`)

Formats debugging data into GDB protocol responses.

## Supported GDB Commands

- Memory read/write commands
- Register access commands
- Breakpoint management
- Execution control (continue, step, etc.)
- Target information queries

For implementation details, see the [GDB Protocol](../advanced/gdb-protocol.md) documentation.
