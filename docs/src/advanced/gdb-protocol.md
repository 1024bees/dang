# GDB Protocol Implementation

Details about DANG's implementation of the GDB Remote Serial Protocol (RSP).

## Protocol Overview

The GDB Remote Serial Protocol enables debuggers to communicate with debug targets over various transports. DANG implements this protocol to provide a familiar debugging interface for waveform-based debugging.

## Supported Commands

- Memory read/write operations
- Register access
- Breakpoint management
- Execution control
- Target queries

## Implementation Details

DANG's protocol implementation is located in the Shucks module and provides full compatibility with standard GDB and LLDB debuggers.
